# TheResistance

is the name of my first attempt using C# and the Asp.net framework. It is the beginning of a personal blog.  You can download the files and open them in Visual Studio Community 2017. The project is a web project so the best way I've found to initiate the program is to build the Index.cshtml or the Create.cshtml file (in the Posts Folder inside the Views Folder) in VS without Debug by pressing CTRL+F5 and choosing Chrome so you can view my design and sample the navigation through the CRUD functions. I decided not to host online since I currently have no authentication.  Thanks.
